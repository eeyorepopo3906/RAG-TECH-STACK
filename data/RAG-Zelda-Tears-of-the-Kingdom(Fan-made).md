Continuing the series' tradition of open-world exploration and puzzle-solving elements, players once again take on the role of the protagonist, Link, embarking on a new adventure.

Players must solve various puzzles, overcome formidable foes, and gradually unravel the secrets hidden within the Kingdom of Tears.

In terms of gameplay, "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom" presents players with a wealth of exploration elements and quests. With a main storyline nearly twice the length of its predecessor, featuring multiple intertwined storylines, players may chart their own paths forward while pursuing the common goal of finding Zelda and defeating Ganon. Additionally, the game introduces new abilities like the glider suit, enhancing player mobility in the air. Temple puzzles, armor sets, and significant weapon collections further enrich the gaming experience.

Featuring notably enhanced graphics and sound effects, the game offers players a deeply immersive experience. It excels in gameplay depth and overall completion, regarded as a single-player, open-world, role-playing game that stands on par with its predecessor. With its high degree of freedom, the game provides players with an expansive stage where they can explore from sky to ground freely.

## Character Introduction

### **Link**

Protagonist

The hero who defeated the Calamity Ganon in "Breath of the Wild." While investigating the underground of Hyrule Castle, he becomes involved in a cataclysm. He will utilize the new power obtained in his right hand to once again confront the calamity engulfing Hyrule.

### **Zelda**

Princess of Hyrule

The heroine of the "Legend of Zelda" series, she is the princess of Hyrule with divine powers and possesses the sealing power passed down through generations. She rules the kingdom as a princess in the absence of the king. She willingly sacrifices herself to seal the calamity known as Ganondorf, which threatens the kingdom.

As a Hylian, she values all the inhabitants of the Hyrule continent, including the various races.

This time, with Link's help, she is freed from the long-sealed mission and suddenly disappears while working tirelessly for Hyrule's revival.

### **Ganondorf**

Dark Lord

Awakened from his seal, Ganondorf is an ancient evil who appeared during the founding era of Hyrule. He wields the "Triforce of Power" and seeks to dominate the entire land of Hyrule, making him the arch-nemesis of Link and Zelda.

For a long time, he has been sealed underground in Hyrule Castle. However, damage to Hyrule Castle caused by the calamity a hundred years ago weakened the seal, allowing him to slowly regain his strength and emerge as a threat beyond imagination.

### **King Rhoam**

King of Hyrule

The first king of Hyrule, he is also the guardian of the underwater world and serves as a wise guide during the player's exploration and combat journey.

As a king, he spares no effort to protect his subjects, even at the cost of his own life. He fought alongside six sages to defeat Ganondorf, including traveling through time to the era of Hyrule's founding alongside Zelda.

He is a mysterious and important guardian responsible for maintaining the peace of the underwater world. Due to his long life in the underwater world, his appearance gradually resembles that of marine creatures, exuding a mysterious and ancient aura.

He is also considered a wise guide, teaching players various exploration and combat skills to help them improve their strength and master the secrets of the game. This indicates his role in the game as an educator and guide, not just a combat companion.

### **Mineru**

Sage of Souls

Lao Lu's older sister, she fought alongside him as a sage against Ganondorf during the mythical era.

Although seriously injured in battle, she transferred her soul into a Pura slate, surviving into the modern era. She believes she is responsible for the birth of Ganondorf from the Pura slate and swears to Zelda to do her best to defeat Ganondorf in the modern era.

### **Master Kohga**

Returned leader of the Yiga Clan

The leader of the Yiga Clan, an organization hostile to the Kingdom of Hyrule. Due to his presence and inexplicable prestige, his subordinates greatly admire him. He was thought to have fallen into the underground during a battle with Link, but actually survived.

He aspires to bring about the world's destruction alongside a great being and dispatches members to carry out related actions across the land.

### **Tauru**

Leader of the Lanayru Investigation Team

His enthusiasm for investigating the Lanayru civilization is unparalleled throughout Hyrule, and he sometimes unintentionally speaks in dialect when excited by significant discoveries.

For a long time, he has been investigating ruins around the world alone and is proficient in Lanayru script. Princess Zelda values his abilities and promotes him to the leader of the investigation team.

### **Purah**

Director of the Monitoring Fortress

The foremost authority on ancient technology. She became a direct researcher for the Kingdom of Hyrule at a young age and recently researched the Lanayru civilization together with Princess Zelda, as well as investigated the sudden appearance of miasma in Hyrule Castle.

She once experimented on herself as a test subject for rejuvenation research, so even though her actual age is over a hundred years, she still looks like a child...

### **Robeli**

Technical Chief of the Purah Slate

Different in appearance, but exceptionally skilled as a technician.

The Akkala Ancient Research Institute was his former base. He provided considerable assistance to Link with his research achievements. After that, he worked with Purah at the Hateno Ancient Research Institute on the development of the Purah Slate. Despite his contributions, his name was not included in the naming, which he resents.

### **Joshua**

Head of the Underground Investigation Team

A genius girl with unexpected talent, admired for her admirable talent. She is also one of the leading experts in underground research. She is delighted to be able to search for clues about Princess Zelda with the highly respected Purah and is dedicated to collecting underground intelligence day and night.

### **Ayun**

Leader of the Ayun Team

He once saved the youth of Kakariko Village with Link. After Death Mountain ceased to erupt, he entered the previously inaccessible area and discovered that it could be mined. So he gathered admirers to form the Ayun team, aiming to make the Goron tribe more prosperous.

He should have been a kind-hearted young man...?

After taking off the suspicious mask, he returned to his formerly kind personality.

## Monster Guide

In *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, the variety of monsters is abundant, offering players various materials upon defeat. Let's explore the comprehensive monster guide in the game.

### Chuchu

These gelatinous creatures resemble slimes but with protruding eyes, often invoking disgust in players, causing most to eliminate them on sight. The Chuchu family comprises four types: Regular Chuchu, Ice Chuchu, Electric Chuchu, and Fire Chuchu, each representing a different elemental property.

Especially noteworthy are Ice Chuchus, capable of freezing enemies upon attack. Upon defeat, they drop Chuchu Jelly, White Chuchu Jelly, Yellow Chuchu Jelly, and Red Chuchu Jelly. Don't underestimate the drops of these low-level monsters; they have various applications throughout the game. For instance, Chuchu Jelly is essential for cleaning mud off bows, a necessary tool for traversing the Wind Temple.

#### Regular Chuchu

- Main habitats: Hylia Plains, East Hatter
- Collectible materials: Chuchu Jelly

Features:

- Gelatinous low-level monsters inhabiting all of Hylia.
- They emerge suddenly from the ground or trees, with varying health depending on their size.
- Allegedly, the nature of the gelatinous substances dropped from them changes when heated, cooled, or subjected to electrical stimulation.

#### Ice Chuchu

- Collectible materials: White Chuchu Jelly
- Main habitats: Hebra Mountains, Gerudo Highlands

Features:

- Gelatinous low-level monsters covered in frost.
- Varying health based on their size.
- Striking them carelessly may cause them to rupture, releasing a chilling aura, posing a significant danger. Hence, it's safer to attack them from a distance.

#### Electric Chuchu

- Main habitats: West Hatter, Gerudo Desert
- Collectible materials: Yellow Chuchu Jelly

Features:

- Gelatinous low-level monsters enveloped in electricity.
- Their health varies depending on their size.
- Careless strikes may cause them to rupture, emitting electric shocks, which can be extremely hazardous. It's advisable to attack them from a distance.

#### Fire Chuchu

- Main habitats: Eldin Canyon, Eldin Mountains
- Collectible materials: Red Chuchu Jelly

Features:

- Gelatinous low-level monsters engulfed in flames.
- Varying health based on their size.
- Striking them carelessly may cause them to rupture and explode. Hence, it's safer to attack them from a distance.

### Keese

The Keese family consists of Regular Keese, Ice Keese, Electric Keese, and Fire Keese. They can be distinguished by the elemental properties they possess. Defeating them yields various Keese Wings and Keese Eyeballs, essential ingredients for crafting Tracking Arrows, a highly useful tool in the game. Therefore, players are likely to hunt down the Keese family extensively.

### Bokoblin

Resembling the familiar goblins but with pig-like heads, they are affectionately referred to as Bokoblins. They are categorized into several types: Stalk Bokoblin, Bokoblin, Blue Bokoblin, Black Bokoblin, Silver Bokoblin, and Gold Bokoblin. The first two types only drop their horns and teeth. Blue and Black Bokoblins drop an extra liver. Silver and Gold Bokoblins are relatively rare in the game, dropping various parts as well as precious items like Amber, Sapphire, Ruby, and Diamond.

### Moblin

Moblins include Stalk Moblin, Moblin, Blue Moblin, Black Moblin, Silver Moblin, and Gold Moblin. Their loot mechanism is similar to Bokoblins. Noteworthy is that Moblins can wield two-handed weapons, capable of interrupting player attacks. However, single-handed weapons do not pose such concerns.

### Lizalfos Warriors

These include Blue, Black, Electric, Ice, Fire, Silver, and Gold Lizalfos Warriors. They drop horns, claws, and tails. Similar to the aforementioned monsters, the Silver and Gold Lizalfos Warriors yield various gemstones along with their own materials. Lizalfos Warriors boast remarkably high movement speed compared to other monsters, so players must remain vigilant when facing them, especially during nighttime encounters.

### Octo

Octos are fascinating creatures. Water Octos float during rainy weather, Forest and Snow Octos camouflage themselves as surrounding plants, Rock Octos help rid weapons of rust, and Treasure Octos disguise themselves as treasure chests. Defeating them yields various types of Rupees. Sky Octos serve as red alert units.

### Lynels

Lynels come in Blue, White, Silver, and Gold variants, often referred to by players as centaurs. They are terrifying adversaries in the early stages, boasting high attack power and formidable health. Players are advised to steer clear when encountering them.
